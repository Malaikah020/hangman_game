# the words should be in a list and then a random one should be chosen and then you use it as secret word.
# let user input letters - letterguessed and see if they are in the secret word if they are 
# add them to ans if not remove letter from alphabet and print
# if there is no letters left to guess return congrats
# if you've used all you guesses return you killed hangman
